# Trivia Server

This is the trivia.run server. You can run it by installing / starting Docker and then running "make up-dev". You can then run either the game or admin client against it by running "npm run dev" in either of their directories.

All updates to the "main" branch get automatically deployed to trivia.run. You can also just ignore all this code and run the game / admin panels against the currently running instance on trivia.run by starting them with the "npm run dev-staging" command instead.
